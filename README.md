## 👽 后端开发

For the backend, personally I would prefer Node.js and PHP 7 for the full time. Plus, I have been experimenting lately with Go and I quite like it. Apart from these, if I have to choose another one, I would go for Ruby. However this is just my personal preference, you can choose any of the shown languages and you will be good.
